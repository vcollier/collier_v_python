# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

### Pick your weapon and play against computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](http://www.python.org/download.releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - <code>cd directory name </code> - and run the game.py file in a python 3 Terminal window for mac / Linux. 

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers rock.
2. Scissors cuts Paper.
3. Rock smashes Scissors.

**_Choose you weapon wisely!_**

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.
